[Shiro](http://shiro.apache.org/) is a flexible authentication and authorization framework for Java that has a corresponding [Grails plugin](http://grails.org/plugin/shiro) for simplifying access control in Grails applications. This plugin extends the base Shiro plugin with support for authentication using the [Shiro CAS integration](https://shiro.apache.org/cas.html).
